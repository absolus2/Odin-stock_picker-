# Odin-stock_picker-

This took me a while to figure it out too, I'm still not sure if my answer is 
good enough...

Create a stock_pick method to get an array indices for the best day to buy and
sell stock, I started by creating two arrays with the biggest value and smallest
of the stock, Proceed to loop throught the biggest value array and then through
the smallest, and check if the index of big value was greater than the small if 
so, return an array of the indices of both values.
